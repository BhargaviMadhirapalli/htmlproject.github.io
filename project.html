        The main objective of this is to create a single web application 
        using some python libraries like stream lit and matplot.
        It helps us to understand the data in a visualized matter.

        <pre>
            The main aim is to identify whether a particular patient is affected by CKD or not and it has to be
            accurate and precise. So, for that we are going to purpose a correlate four preexisting Machine
            Learning Algorithms to find the best among all. For this purpose, we gathered a
            CKD data set from UCI machine learning repository and we examining the correlation between the
            development of the CKD and predictors using a predictive approach of the
            analysis. This will help us to reduce the number of required parameters to predict
            the CKD disease occurrence as well as eliminating the missing, redundant and
            noisy data. And we have to use certain features to measure its accuracy and
            predictions.
