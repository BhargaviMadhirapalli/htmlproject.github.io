    <pre> <strong>Good Morning sir/madam,</strong>
        I am Bhargavi,
        I recently graduated from Tirumala Engineering College with a degree in
        Information Technology with an aggregate of 7.8 CGPA.
        Acquired skills and knowledge on some technical languages known as 
        C programming, Java, Python. 
        Currently i'm doing <em>Full Stack Web Development Course</em> in <strong>TAP Academy.</strong>
        I am a self-motivated, and disciplined soul. I am always keen to
        up-skill myself by learning new things whenever i get a chance.
